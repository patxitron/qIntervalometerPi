# Intervalometer

This intervalometer is for my Samsung NX500 based on
[DIY Remote shutter release for Samsung NX-series cameras](https://antibore.wordpress.com/2013/04/30/diy-remote-shutter-release-for-samsung-nx20-nx210-and-nx1000-cameras/)
by "antibore".

In this case I used NPN bipolar transistors instead of the MOSFET open drain from
the microcontroller, and it works ok.
